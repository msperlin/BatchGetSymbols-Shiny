<h3>About</h3>

<p>
    This web interface was built using <a
        href="https://rstudio.github.io/shinydashboard/get_started.html">shiny dashboard</a>, and is hosted in my own private server. All financial data
    available here is imported from Yahoo Finance, based on R package <a href="https://github.com/msperlin/BatchGetSymbols">BatchGetSymbols</a>. In this web app you can use the same code, but with a convenient graphical interface.

<h3>Source Code</h3>
<p>
    The code for this shiny application is available at <a
        href="https://github.com/msperlin/BatchGetSymbols-Shiny">Github</a>.
